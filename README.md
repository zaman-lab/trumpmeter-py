# Trumpmeter (Python)

The "Trumpmeter" is a convolutional neural network trained to classify the degree to which any given Tweet expresses sentiments about President Trump on a numeric scale from zero to one, where lower scores represent anti-Trump and higher scores represent pro-Trump.

This repository contains a Python application for running the classifier via command-line interface or Twitter Bot. :bird: :robot:

See the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to run the classifier yourself!
